# Sudoku_Solver
 The Sudoku Solver project uses the backtracking algorithm to solve a given Sudoku puzzle by filling in empty cells with valid numbers while adhering to Sudoku rules. It demonstrates recursion, backtracking, and the validation of constraints (row, column, and 3x3 grid) in a real-world problem.
